# 🎲 Rust Number Guessing Game

Welcome to the **Rust Number Guessing Game**! This is a fun command-line game where you try to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. Perfect for practicing Rust basics! 🚀

## 📝 How It Works
1. The program generates a random number between **1** and **100**.
2. You try to guess the number.
3. The program gives feedback:
   - 🔼 **Too High** if your guess is greater than the secret number.
   - 🔽 **Too Low** if your guess is less than the secret number.
   - 🎉 **You Win!** if you guess the number correctly.

## 📦 Dependencies
This game requires the **rand** crate for random number generation. Make sure to include it in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
rand = "0.8" # or the latest version

git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <project-folder>
